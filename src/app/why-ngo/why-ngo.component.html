    <h2>What is an NGO?</h2>
    <p>
      A Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) is a group formed by people who want
      to bring about positive change in society without seeking profit. They
      operate independently of the government and focus on solving real issues
      such as poverty, inequality, health, education, environment, and human
      rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      NGOs are often called the “voice of the people”, as they represent
      communities that may otherwise go unheard. Their activities range from
      providing direct aid and services to conducting awareness campaigns and
      influencing policies for long-term impact.

    <h2>Why NGOs Matter</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Reach where others can’t:</b> NGOs often work in remote or neglected areas where government systems have limitations.</li>
      <li><b>Encourage participation:</b> They involve local communities in decision-making, ensuring that solutions are practical and inclusive.</li>
      <li><b>Promote innovation:</b> Many NGOs introduce creative, small-scale solutions that later inspire larger policy changes.</li>
      <li><b>Ensure accountability:</b> By raising concerns and pushing for reforms, NGOs help keep institutions transparent and responsible.</li>
      <li><b>Build partnerships:</b> They collaborate with governments, businesses, and international agencies to maximize impact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How NGOs Operate</h2>
    <p>
      NGOs sustain themselves through donations, grants, volunteer work, and
      partnerships. Their non-profit nature ensures that the focus remains on
      service and development rather than financial gain. They are flexible in
      their approach and can quickly adapt to changing social needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At their core, NGOs are about people helping people – driven by
      compassion, responsibility, and a vision of a better world.
